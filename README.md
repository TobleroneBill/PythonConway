Conways Game in Python

This is 1.0, Which is really slow, but have a few ideas on how to optimise. I just needed something working before I go and made it not run at literally < 1fps.

CONTROLS:
R - randomize what pieces to be alive or dead
T - move ahead 1 step*
SPACEBAR - Set to run mode and see the magic*
left/right click - left = set cell to alive, right = off

*These will make you think the program has crashed (because it takes probably like 10 seconds to calculate the results)
Will be updating this to make it not SHIT
